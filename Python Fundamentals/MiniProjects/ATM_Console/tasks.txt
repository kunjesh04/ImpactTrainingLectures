Design a ATM Console.

Program should run until and unless user stops the Program
4 options on Screen :
    1. Withdrawal
    2. Deposit
    3. Mini Statement
    4. Exit

Opening Balance = 20000

After any transactions; balance should be displayed.

Withdrawal:
    => Amount should be entered in multiple of 100. 
    => Withdrawal amt < Balance
    => If Withdrawal > 10000; it should ask for otp
        OTP should be exactly of 4 digits

Deposit:
    => User should tell whcih notes he is giving (100, 200, 500)
    => Total Amt to deposit should also be told by user and has to be multiple of 100
    => Check if notes*num_of_notes matches the total amt

Mini Statement:
    => Display previous 5 transactions.
    => Eg : +5000, -3500, ...

Exit :
    => display 'ATM Exited'
